 Pandas module Homework
 Trends Identified:
 1. Male lead by far the purchasers in Heroes of Pymoli vs. Female and other
 2. The average age of the players is 22, however the standard deviation is 6.6 which shows that there is a broad market across generation
 3. The range of age with highest purchases are between 20-24, however as commented on the previous point, there is also an important quantity of player between 15-19 and 25-29.
 4. The top 5 players did a total purchased between 18.96 and 13.10, this mean around 5 purchases. Considering a 179 items available, is a low rate of continuous purchases from players.
 5. The above is confirmed by the total player on the Top seller items, as the no. 1 has only 13 from 179.
 6. I would recommend to focus on a cathaloge that increase the repeated purchases by player, reducing the diversity and have cathegories more adequated to a targeted market.
